    <p class="text-muted">EV owner data is not publicly available, but EV charging station location data is available as well as demographic data.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">Use EV charging station locations as a proxy for EV ownership and use demographic data for locations with EV charging stations as a proxy for EV owner qualities.</p>

          <strong>Field experiment</strong>: Conduct an A/B test for individual ad targeting (target a set of people we think are likely to purchase and EV and a set of random people and compare click rates among both groups; ideally the click rate would be higher for our targeted group compared to the random group). This could also help validate the power of the models.

          Look at dates of EV stations opening and determine which locations are growing fastest (<strong>time series analysis</strong>), take this into account in our predictive models
        </li>
        <li>
          Acquire <strong>additional data</strong> such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Regional Car sales trend month over month to find the best time to influence buyers</li>
            <li>Weather data to find if it has an influence on people's interest in electric cars</li>
            <li>More detailed regional advertising costs</li>
          </ul>

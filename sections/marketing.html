    <h3>Lead Rating</h3>
    <br />
    <p>The Marketing team acquires "leads" of prospective electric car buyers from different sources - it could be an internet user searching for electric cars to list of people registering certain brands of cars at DMVs. Once a lead is acquired, marketing will pursue the lead through various channels. For Faraday motors, it is imperative that we be able to rate the lead in terms of likelihood that they will buy an electric car.</p>
    <p>
      Most lead sources will provide basic demographic attributes of the person including age, gender, household income range, highest education, home ownership and location. To create a rating system for leads, we re-used the Random Forest model and limited it to these demographic attributes. We expanded the features to include each of the categorical variables - for e.g Female,25-35,100K>Income>150K, Female,35-50,100K>Income>150K etc.  We re-ran the models and then extracted the relative feature importance scores for these attributes and normalized the scores. This relative ranking was then used to create a simplified linear model to rate the leads.  
    </p>
    <p>The lead rating algorithm we built could be used as a standalone calculator, real-time rating system or bulk batch rater.</p>

    <h3>Persona modeling</h3>
    <br />
    <p>To fine-tune the process of data-driven marketing decisions, we also helped build a persona modeling tool. Buyer personas (sometimes referred to as marketing personas) are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers. Personas help us all -- in marketing, sales, product, and services -- internalize the ideal customer we're trying to attract, and relate to our customers as real humans. We built these personas based on our models that predicts the demographic attributes of our prospective customer.

    <h3>Ad rates and markets</h3>
    <br />
    <p>The modeling effort helped us identify the best markets and demographics of our potential buyers; but that information by itself is not sufficient to make an effective marketing strategy. In addition to demographic models it is necessary to build a cost model to identify the markets that not only has good target audience but also are cheaper to advertise to. For instance, is it better to advertise in New York city, which could be very expensive and reach a wider audience or advertise in smaller and cheaper cities but still reach a very targeted audience?</p>
    <p>
      In order to help this decision making, we used the regional advertisement rates from the two leading outdoor display ad providers, Clear Channel Outdoor and Lamar. The assumption made here is that the cost of display advertisement is a proxy to the regional cost of advertisement across other marketing channels.

    <h3>Tools, Dashboard and Visualization</h3>
    <br />
    <p>Finally, to consolidate all the tools we built for the marketing team in an easy to use package, we built a <a href="../portal/index.html">marketing data portal</a>. As we formulate more models and data-driven decision parameters, we will enhance the toolkit with additional tools and visualizations.

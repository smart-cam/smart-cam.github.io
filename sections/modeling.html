<p>Surveillance cameras are <del>ubiquitous</del> everywhere. Both <del>individuals and organizations</del> home and business users want to be alerted of any unexpected presence at their house or premises.</p>

<p>Video image processing made it possible to record only what is needed (e.g., when motion or the presence of a certain object or person is detected) instead of indefinitely. Combined with machine learning techniques, it also allows to search patterns that can be useful for businesses such as finding hot spots, the most common paths taken by customers, and the most affluent hours. Hence, surveillance is not the only <del>feature</del> benefit of monitoring systems for business users.</p>



<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>Monitoring systems used to be <del>complex and</del> expensive. The advent of open-source computer-vision libraries like <em>OpenCV</em> and inexpensive single-board computers such as the <em>Raspberry Pi</em> has made building a monitoring system easier than ever, but  a solution based on them still presents some challenges to potential users:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are no out-of-the-box solutions like this: users need <del>the skills</del> to integrate the required hardware and software components.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the user’s needs, the hardware must have enough computing power to perform certain operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Some users may require an integrated system that receives videos from different cameras / locations.</p></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="our-proposal">Our Proposal</h3>

<p>We have built a <strong>cloud-based video monitoring system able to detect motion and count human faces</strong> (we focused on these two features, but others could be easily added in the future), that is simple and inexpensive but also powerful, reliable, and scalable. </p>

<p>The system is aimed at two customer segments: <strong>home</strong> and <strong>business users</strong> (stores, offices, malls, …). Everything they need (at each location they want to monitor) is a Raspberry Pi with a camera module; most of the <del>video</del> processing is done in the cloud and all the information is accessible through a web browser.</p>



<h3 id="value-proposition">Value Proposition</h3>

<p>Our system is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cost-effective</strong>: all the required hardware is a Raspberry Pi with a camera, whose price keeps dropping (the same applies to cloud computing and </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easy-to-install</strong>: users can purchase an standard Raspberry Pi at their convenience and install the necessary software by themselves (following a list of simple steps), or acquire one with the software pre-installed from us.</p>

<ul><li><del>An added benefit for home users in rented houses, who usually do not have the liberty to install comprehensive alarm systems.</del></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalable</strong>: adding more cameras is just a matter of installing and registering additional Raspberry Pis.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Users have <strong>real-time</strong> access to the information: alerts, analytics, and video files.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dual functionality</strong> (especially for business users): The system can be used for surveillance purposes (e.g., once the store is closed) and also to get <del>helpful</del> insights to optimize business. For example, it can provide information about the amount of people entering a store (or moving through it) over time, which can be used to predict sales or adjust staff levels.</p>

<ul><li>The face counting feature can also be helpful for home users, once face recognition is added: alerts would not be sent if the face of a person has been previously added to the system.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>The video files are stored in the cloud (so there is no risk that the Raspberry Pi will run out of storage).</p></li>
</ul>





    <h3>Initial Feature Selection and Model Evaluation</h3>
    <br />
    <p>The urban areas data set contains aggregated EV charging stations for 3,600 urban areas and we used the raw station count as our dependent variable or label and turned the modeling exercise into a classic supervised learning problem. The predictors or independent variables are the demographic covariates from the Census American Community Survey data and EV incentives. The diagram below illustrates our modeling methodology and approach.</p>
    <br />

    <br />
    <p>We took two parallel paths, a path for finding the best algorithm for the problem with an initial feature set and another path for systematic feature search and optimization, to arrive at an optimal model. We selected an initial set of the features from the original set of 73 demographic features, based on our ‘gut’ instinct and recent EV surveys. The initial features selected include number of high-income households, education levels (e.g., % of college graduates), home ownership, and the populations of different age groups.</p>
    <p>Our initial models contained 10 and 25 features and we ran the following 4 different learners, two linear learners: linear regression and logistic regression, and two ensemble learners: Random Forest and extremely randomized decision trees. To evaluate the different learners, we first examined the various scores found that the average accuracy and the R^2 scores were most useful. We then visually examined the predicted charging station counts vs. the actual charing station counts.</p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Our visual examination was critical for us to quickly assess different learners to choose the best algorithm for the problem. Overfitting was obvious visually: when the predicted vs actual station counts for training set all line up diagonally while the predicted vs. actual counts for the test set scatter or cluster above or below the diagonal line, we know that the algorithm overfitted the training set. We found that ensemble learners were more accurate than the linear learners by 14-27%. Random Forest was the best learner based on our evaluation criteria.

  <h3>Feature Selection and Minimal Optimal Model</h3>
  <p>Our goal is to discover demographic attributes that are not obviously correlated with EV prevalence or interest. We used a novel feature selection algorithm proposed by Kursa and Rudnicki (http://www.jstatsoft.org/v36/i11/paper). The algorithm iteratively eliminates features via statistical tests. We used the Python implemention by Daniel Homola (https://bitbucket.org/danielhomola/boruta_py/). Running the selection algorithm for all available features consistently returned a set of 9 or so attributes which provided us with valuable insights. Many of the significant features returned by the search algorithm coincide with our initial instinct. Features such as the number of households with income over $100,000, the populations of young people in the 25 to 34 year old and the 35 to 44 year old age groups, and total number of college graduates, showed up consistently in the outputs. We confirmed that the raw number of EV charging stations did not track population and other features were more significant for EV prevalence. A result that we were hoping to get from the start!</p>
  <p>Combining the feature search outputs and that from the ad-hoc modeling, we selected 14 features for our “minimal optimal” feature set to feed into a Random Forest model. Theoretically, Occam’s Razor calls for models that contain all that is necessary but nothing more. Practically, a minimal optimal model is attractive for it provides the best explanation of the data and also has the most predictive power but with the smallest set of relevant features. Our final model has excellent predictive power with scores >85% and is also not sensitive to the number of features as long as the most significant features such as, the households of the highest income brackets and the population of young age groups, are included. We used the output from our optimal model to predict the “best markets” for Faraday Motor’s marketing division.
